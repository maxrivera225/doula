			<p class="intro"> <p><span>QUEENS, NY —</span>Eighteen months after rolling out a doula program at Elmhurst hospital, the program struggles to meet the needs of pregnant people and doulas alike, according to parents and doulas. The announcement of last year’s program was part of a series of <a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/pressrelease/elmhurst-and-queens-launch-hope-doula-program/" target="_blank"> policy</a> efforts by officials to make New York City one of the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/642-22/mayor-adams-signs-legislation-providing-doula-services-across-five-boroughs-strengthen-maternal#/0" target="_blank"> “safest”</a>  places to give birth.

		<p>“Since we launched the HoPE program in April 2022, we have had some clients who were not able to be matched to a doula due to lack of capacity,” Atiya Butler, a spokesperson for Health and Hospitals said.<p>

				<p>Butler said the HoPE Doula Program’s capacity limitations are due to a lack of bilingual doulas.<p>
				
				<p>“Medicine has not been immune to the legacy of racism, and it has infected the way we care for minoritized communities across this city and this nation for too long,” said Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan on Monday.<p>

				<p>“Racism is why Black people are not safe in hospitals,” she said.<p>
